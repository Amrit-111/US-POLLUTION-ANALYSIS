üåç U.S. Pollution Analysis Power BI Project

I'm thrilled to present my latest Power BI project, diving deep into the realm of environmental data with a comprehensive U.S. Pollution Analysis. 
This project aims to shed light on the impact of pollutants‚ÄîCarbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)‚Äîacross the United States from 2006 to 2010.

Project Highlights:

üìä Overview Page:

Interactive insights on the four major pollutants with action-page navigation.
Slicers for states, cities, counties, and pollution-affected years.
Filled map showcasing pollution distribution across U.S. states.
Table displaying county names and codes.
Quarter-wise bifurcation of all four pollutants.
Individual Pollutant Pages:

Carbon Monoxide (CO):

Top 10 states with the highest CO pollutants.
1st maximum hour and value for CO displayed with cards.
CO units calculated per specific metrics.
Table showing CO in AQI for each state with dynamic color coding.
Charts depicting maximum CO levels in each state and yearly trends.
Top CO-polluted city, synchronized slicers for interactive analysis.
Ozone (O3):

Top 10 states with the highest O3 pollutants.
